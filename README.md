# Recipe Finder App

Excited to share my latest project: a Recipe Finder App built with React! üçΩÔ∏èüöÄ I've been diving deep into frontend development and recently completed a fun and challenging project where I created a Recipe Finder App using React and integrated the Edamam API for recipe data. üìäüíª

2. **Recipe Details**: Detailed information about each recipe, including ingredients and cooking instructions.
   
3. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the app looks great on all devices.
   
4. **Problem-Solving**: Overcame challenges in error handling and data presentation to enhance app reliability.
   
5. **Project Planning and Execution**: Improved my project management skills by breaking down tasks, setting milestones.
