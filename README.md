Excited to share my latest project: a Recipe Finder App built with React! 🍽️🚀
I've been diving deep into frontend development and recently completed a fun and challenging project where I created a Recipe Finder App using React and integrated the Edamam API for recipe data. 📊💻

##Key features of the app include:

1️⃣ Search Functionality: Users can search for recipes based on dish names.

2️⃣ Recipe Details: Detailed information about each recipe, including ingredients and cooking instructions.

3️⃣ Responsive Design: Ensuring the app looks great on all devices.

4️⃣ Problem-Solving: Overcame challenges in error handling and data presentation to enhance app reliability.

5️⃣ Project Planning and Execution: Improved my project management skills by breaking down tasks, setting milestones.
